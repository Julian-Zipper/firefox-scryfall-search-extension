# Scryfall search extension for Firefox
Quickly search for Magic TCG cards with a !scry command from your Firefox url bar

# Usage instructions
- to activate the Firefox extension, type `!scry ` in your url bar (note the space after scry)
- after `!scry `, type anything you'd type in the scryfall search bar, F.E. `!scry set:STX t:spirit`
- Select the 2nd option in the dropdown menu (clicking it, or pressing down & enter)

# Future updates
- Currently trying to figure out how to just press enter after a command to go to the resulting URL, alongside always having to go to the 2nd option in the dropdown menu.
