# Scryfall search extension for firefox
quickly search for cards with a !scry command from your url bar

# Usage instructions
- to activate the extension, type `!scry ` in your url bar (note the space after scry)
- after `!scry `, type anything you'd type in the scryfall search bar, F.E. `!scry set:STX t:spirit`
- Select the 2nd option in the dropdown menu (clicking it, or pressing down & enter)

# Future updates
- trying to figure out how to just press enter after a command, instead of having to go to the 2nd option in the dropdown menu.
